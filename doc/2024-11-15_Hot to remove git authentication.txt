If you want to remove the SSH key authentication setup from your computer, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Remove SSH Key from GitHub
1. Go to your GitHub account.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **SSH and GPG keys**.
3. Find the SSH key you want to remove and click **Delete**.

### Step 2: Remove SSH Key from Local Machine
1. **Delete the SSH Key Files**: Locate the SSH key files on your computer and delete them. By default, they are usually stored in the `~/.ssh` directory.
   ```sh
   rm ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   rm ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```
2. **Edit the SSH Configuration (if applicable)**: If you have specific configurations in your SSH config file, you can remove or comment them out. The config file is usually located at `~/.ssh/config`.
   ```sh
   nano ~/.ssh/config
   ```
   Comment out or remove the lines related to the GitHub configuration.

### Step 3: Update Git Remote URL
If you configured Git to use SSH, you will need to update the remote URL to use HTTPS instead. Navigate to your repository and run:
```sh
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
```

### Summary:
1. **Delete the SSH key** from your GitHub account.
2. **Remove the SSH key files** from your local machine.
3. **Update the Git remote URL** to use HTTPS.

By following these steps, you will disable the auto-authentication using SSH on your current setup.

Yes, authentication is necessary when pushing code to a remote repository like GitHub. This ensures that only authorized users can make changes to the repository. GitHub provides several methods for authentication:

### Methods of Authentication:
1. **Username and Password**: You can use your GitHub username and password, but GitHub now requires using a personal access token instead of a password for better security.
2. **Personal Access Tokens (PAT)**: These tokens are an alternative to passwords. You can generate them in your GitHub account settings under "Developer settings" > "Personal access tokens".
3. **SSH Keys**: By generating an SSH key pair and adding the public key to your GitHub account, you can securely push and pull changes without repeatedly entering your credentials.
4. **OAuth**: OAuth tokens are another secure way to authenticate and authorize applications.

### Example: Using Personal Access Tokens
1. **Generate a PAT**: Go to [GitHub Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and generate a new token with appropriate permissions.
2. **Use the PAT**: When Git asks for your password during `git push`, use the generated token instead of your GitHub password.

### Example: Using SSH Keys
1. **Generate SSH Key**:
   ```sh
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.email@example.com"
   ```
   Follow the prompts to save the key files.
2. **Add SSH Key to GitHub**:
   - Copy the public key:
     ```sh
     cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
     ```
   - Add it to your GitHub account under "Settings" > "SSH and GPG keys".
3. **Configure Git to Use SSH**:
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:yourusername/your-repository.git
   ```

With these methods, you can authenticate securely and push your changes to GitHub without any hassle. 
If you need further assistance with setting up any of these methods, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š

Absolutely! Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use Git locally and push your changes to a remote GitHub repository:

### Step 1: Install Git
If you haven't already installed Git, you can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

### Step 2: Set Up Git
After installing Git, configure your username and email:

```sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### Step 3: Initialize a Local Repository
Navigate to the directory where you want to initialize a Git repository and run:

```sh
git init
```

### Step 4: Add Files to the Repository
Add the files you want to track to the repository:

```sh
git add .
```

### Step 5: Commit the Changes
Commit the added files with a descriptive message:

```sh
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### Step 6: Link to a Remote Repository
If you haven't created a repository on GitHub, do so. Once you have the repository URL, link it to your local repository:

```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
```

### Step 7: Push the Changes
Push your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub:

```sh
git push -u origin master
```

### Detailed Breakdown:
1. **Install Git**: Ensures you have Git installed on your system.
2. **Set Up Git**: Configures your Git user information.
3. **Initialize a Local Repository**: Sets up a new Git repository in your project directory.
4. **Add Files**: Stages all files in the directory for the next commit.
5. **Commit Changes**: Creates a snapshot of the project's current state.
6. **Link to Remote**: Adds the URL of your remote GitHub repository.
7. **Push Changes**: Sends your committed changes to the remote repository.

### Additional Tips:
- **Branch Management**: If you want to work on a different branch, you can create and switch to it using:

  ```sh
  git checkout -b new-branch
  ```

- **Pulling Updates**: Before pushing changes, it's a good practice to pull the latest changes from the remote repository:

  ```sh
  git pull origin master
  ```

I hope this helps you get started with Git and GitHub!

If you've only completed step 1, which is **creating your GitHub account**, 
then your account security is not fully optimized. Without additional security measures like **two-factor authentication (2FA)**, 
your account is more vulnerable to unauthorized access.

Regarding SSH keys, if someone has access to your local computer and your SSH private key, 
they could potentially access your GitHub repositories. 
It's crucial to keep your SSH private key secure and not share it with others.

To enhance your account security, I recommend enabling **two-factor authentication (2FA)** and using a strong, unique password. 
This adds an extra layer of protection to your account.
Would you like more information on how to set up 2FA or manage SSH keys securely?
